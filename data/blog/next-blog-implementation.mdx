**Update** : I've now ported my blog, again, to a new framework.  See my new [post](next-blog-implementation).

# Introduction

I've spent the past few weeks updating this blog from the python-based [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) framework to the Javascript-based [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) framework.
Overall, it's been a challenging but rewarding experience.  I've learned a little bit about the React framework as well as Gatsby's plugin
ecosystem.  I thought a brief overview of some of the challenges I faced could be of use to other bloggers looking to make the switch.

- **Next JS**
  
  I chose a Gatsby blog theme from [LekoArts](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog/). It's a nice, simple design with all the features I need for blog site. One complicating issue I found was that the theme ships as a 
  "shadowed" theme [plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2019-04-29-component-shadowing/) with a set of core and blog specific components.  In order to modify the theme, I had to combine components from both plugins into a single local plugin.

- **Tailwind**
  
  The blog theme uses [ThemeUI](https://theme-ui.com/home/).  This library enables the Light and Dark mode button at the top of the page as well as the responsive layout.

- **Katex**
  
  The blog uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for markdown parsing. This is extended version of markdown that allows you to blend JSX and markdown in the same file.  The only issue I had came from trying to incorporate Latex into my posts (discussed below).  For Latex rendering, MDX depends on the `remark-math` module.  As I explain below, I had some compatiblility issues
  between `remark-math` and other gatsby plugins.     

- **Syntax Highlighting (Prism)**
  
  The site uses [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) for syntax highlighting. Overall it works well. One of the nice features is the line highlighting in code snippets.  For example, I can specify the specific lines that I want to emphasize in a snippet

  ```python {2,4}
  istrike = 0.04
  notional = 50000
  start = today()
  end = start + int(0.246575*365+0.5) # This is from Quantlib unittest
  var_swap = VarianceSwap(SwapType.Long, 0.04, 50000, start, end)
  ```

  The only remaining challenge is for me is to add Cython to the recognized language in Prism.  This can be accomplished using the language `extend` api.  I just need to get it done.  In Prism's defence, highlighting support for Cython is poor everywhere.

- **Publishing**
  
  Publishing is fairly straightforward using the gh-pages node [plugin](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-ru/blob/master/docs/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages.md).

- **Unused Features**
  
  Publishing is fairly straightforward using the gh-pages node [plugin](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-ru/blob/master/docs/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages.md).

# Conclusion

Overall, I think porting the blog was a success. If nothing else, it gave me the opportunity to learn more Javascript.  The Latex issue I encountered is typical of plugin-based systems, nothing unique to Gatsby.  There may be some bugs in the near future, but hopefully I can get them fixed soon.
